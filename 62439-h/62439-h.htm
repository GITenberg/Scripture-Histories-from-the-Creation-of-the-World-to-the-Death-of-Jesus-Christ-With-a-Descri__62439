say, the heavens, the earth, fire, air,
water, birds, beasts, fish, and every
creeping thing. He made man also out
of the dust of the earth, and called his
name <i>Adam</i>. And unto <i>Adam</i> he gave
power over the fish of the sea, the
fowls of the air, the cattle, and every
thing that moved upon the face of the
earth. And <i>Adam</i> was planted in the
garden of <i>Eden</i> to dress it, and keep it,
and was perfectly happy there: for he
knew no sin.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Adam</span> had not been long in the
garden of <i>Eden</i>, before God
Almighty thought fit to increase his
happiness, and considering he was
alone, threw him into a deep sleep,
and took out one of his ribs, from
which he formed <i>Eve</i>, a more beautiful
creature than himself, and allotted her
to be a help-meet for him. <i>Adam</i>, at
first sight of this new and lovely companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
cried out with extacy of joy,
<i>Bone art thou of my bone, and flesh of
my flesh</i>. In this state of bliss they
lived but a short time; for <i>Satan</i>, envying
their happiness, tempted the woman
to eat of the fruit of the tree of
knowledge, which God, to make trial
of their obedience, had strictly charged
them not to touch. The artful insinuations
of the <i>serpent</i>, together with the
beauty of the fruit, prevailed on her to
transgress the divine law. She tasted,
and was highly delighted, and by her
winning behaviour, tempted her husband
to eat also. No sooner had they
swallowed down the gilded bait, but
their eyes were opened, they saw they
were naked, and, conscious of their
guilt, endeavoured to hide themselves
in the garden from the wrath of their
offended Creator; but he soon drove
them from their secret recess; turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
them out of their seat of bliss, and denounced
thereupon not only a heavy
curse upon the <i>serpent</i>, but on them
likewise, though with this ray of mercy
in his anger, <i>that the seed of the woman
should bruise the</i> serpent’s <i>head</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Of</span> all <i>Adam’s</i> sons, <i>Seth</i> was the
best. He and his sons called on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the name of the Lord; but in process
of time, man indulging himself in all
manner of riot and excess, God repented
that he had made him; and determined
to destroy the whole world by
an universal flood. <i>Noah</i>, however,
who was one of <i>Seth’s</i> posterity, found
grace in the eyes of the Lord. Whereupon
God commanded him to build an
ark of sufficient bulk for the reception
of himself, his family, and two of each
species of animals. No sooner were they
entered than the windows of the heavens
were opened, and it rained heavily
for forty days and forty nights. By
this general deluge every living substance
was destroyed, except <i>Noah</i>, his
wife, his three sons and their wives,
and the other creatures that were admitted
with them into the ark. But soon
after the deluge ceased, the earth was
stocked with inhabitants by the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sons of <i>Noah</i>, viz. <i>Shem, Ham, and
Japheth</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Soon</span> after the sons of <i>Noah</i> had
replenished the earth with inhabitants,
they assembled together in the
fruitful plains of <i>Shinar</i>, where they erected
the lofty Tower of <i>Babel</i>, and
vainly attempted to raise its walls to
the very skies, in hopes to make their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
names immortal; but God Almighty
soon baffled their impious and ill-concerted
project, confused their language
so that they could not understand each
other, and scattered and dispersed them
in various tribes all round the world.</p>

the son of <i>David</i> (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wisest of all men) with peace and plenty,
he determined to build a magnificent
temple to the Lord on mount <i>Moriah</i>.
For which purpose he sent to <i>Hiram</i>,
king of <i>Tyre</i>, his father’s ancient friend,
for cedar wood, and other materials requisite
for the accomplishment of his
pious design. All things being duly
prepared, he erected a stately fabric
three stories high, and embellished it
within and without with a vast variety
of fine carved works, profusely overlaid
with gold. As soon as the whole
was complete, <i>Solomon</i> summoned a
numerous assembly of <i>Israelites</i>, and
with the utmost pomp and splendour,
dedicated this glorious building, by
prayer and supplication, to the only true
God.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">When</span> <i>Herod</i> reigned in <i>Judea</i>,
and <i>Augustus Cæsar</i> was emperor
of <i>Rome</i>, there dwelt at <i>Nazareth</i>,
a small city of <i>Galilee</i>, in the <i>Holy Land</i>,
a Virgin whose name was <i>Mary</i>: God
Almighty sent <i>Gabriel</i>, one of his favourite
angels, down from heaven to visit
her, and to reveal to her the secret
purpose of his divine pleasure. <i>Gabriel</i>,
on his first approach, addressed her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the following words, <i>Hail thou that art
highly favoured; the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou among women</i>. <i>Mary</i>
thereupon was troubled and seemed
startled at this salutation. <i>Gabriel</i>, however,
bid her fear not, for that she had
found favour with God. <i>Behold</i>, said
he, <i>thou shalt conceive and bring forth
a son, and shalt call his name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span></i>.
At this she seemed still more surprised;
<i>How shall this be</i>, said she, <i>seeing I
know not a man?</i> Then <i>Gabriel</i> assured
her that the Holy Ghost should overshadow
her; and thereupon, with submission
to the divine will, she made the
following reply: <i>Behold the hand-maid
of the Lord; be it unto me according to
thy word</i>. At which time the Son of God
became incarnate, and was like unto
man, sin only excepted. At thirty
years of age he began to preach, and
his doctrine was most holy, and tends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
only to the glory of God and good of
mankind. He wrought a great number
of miracles, which manifested an infinite
power and goodness. His life
was perfectly holy. We may find therein
an example of all kinds of virtue.
Jesus having lived after this manner
among the Jews, about four years, they
then put him to death; but he rose again
the third day after his death; and
forty days after his resurrection he ascended
into heaven, from whence he
sent the Holy Ghost to his apostles upon
the day of <i>Pentecost</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">The</span> blessed <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> being condemned
by <i>Pilate</i>, was crucified at a
place called <i>Golgotha</i>, between two
thieves. At his death the sun was
darkened, the earth shook, the vail of
the temple was rent in twain, the
graves opened, and many people who
had been dead appeared to their friends.
This great sacrifice was offered up for
out redemption on a <i>Friday</i>, the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the Jewish passover, and the solemn
feast observed by the christian church
called <i>Good Friday</i>.</p>

from the grave, and ascended into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
heaven before the eyes of his blessed
apostles, with whom he promised to
be ever present to the end of the world.
He now sits at the right-hand of God
the Father Almighty, and there is continually
interceding for us poor sinners,
and so will continue to do, till he shall
descend from heaven in all his glory,
to judge both the quick and the dead
at the last day.</p>

<h2><i>Description of St. Paul’s Church.</i></h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">The</span> foundation of this Cathedral
was first laid by <i>Segbert</i>, a <i>Saxon</i>
king, in the year 610, and afterwards
much improved by one <i>Erkenwald</i>,
who was the 4th bishop of <i>London</i>.
The greatest part of it, however, together
with the whole city, was burnt
down in the year 1086. One <i>Mauritius</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the 35th bishop, began to rebuild
it, and in the year 1221 it was completed.
It was then 690 feet long, the
body of it was 102 feet in height and
130 in breadth. The area three acres
and a half, and the tower in the middle
520 feet high, exclusive of a ball of
copper gilt, which was nine feet round,
whereon was a cross 15 feet and a half
high, and upon that an eagle of copper
gilt, which was 4 feet in length. In
this condition it continued till the
year 1666, at which unhappy time it
became once more a heap of ruins in
the second fire of <i>London</i>; but it was
soon after rebuilt at a vast expence, by
that ingenious and justly admired architect
the late Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i>. No
church (that of St. <i>Peter’s</i> of <i>Rome</i> only
excepted) can stand in competition
with it. It is near 500 feet in height.
It is principally composed of Portland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stone, and built according to the ancient
orders of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>. The
inside is most beautifully adorned with
select historical paintings by the late
celebrated master, Sir <i>James Thornhill</i>.
The west front, and the two towers are
more beautiful than those of St. <i>Peter’s</i>.
The choir is spacious and very grand,
and the entrance to it, which is paved
with marble, is exceedingly beautiful.
The west door is the object of particular
admiration, and the north and south
porticos, as well as the pavement of the
church in general, are all excellent
performances.</p>

<p>The expence that attended the erection
of this magnificent Cathedral, the
glory of <i>England</i>, amounted (as appears
by an accurate estimate thereof laid before
the parliament in the year 1721)
to no less than eight hundred and ten
thousand pounds.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
